# Kraken-Slayer-Game-with-JavaScript

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is a small game I made with JavaScript to cememnt my understanding of the basics. 
I randomised the oucomes to be between 0 and 99. 
Then, I fixed an outcome each for when the random number is over 50 or below it to determine whether a player wins or loses.
